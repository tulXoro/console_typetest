# Description
This is a simple application that mimicks a typing test in most websites. I built this to primarily help children and teens learn about the fundamentals of programming.

# Usage
You may use this project however you see fit.

# How to start
Make sure you have python installed or use an IDE. Add sentences into `sentences.txt` and run the program. The timer does not start until you correctly start typing the first letter.
